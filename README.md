# TDAForITD
An Implementation of the "Topological Data Analysis for Image Tampering Detection" - Approche in Python.
Original introduced by Aras Asaad and Sabah Jassim (2017)

## Requirements
You need python3 and it's package-installer tool installed on your system.
You can download [Python 3 here](https://www.python.org/)
We also provide a MAKEFILE to install all dependencies, run the unit-test session and the application.
It is not necessary to use this MAKEFILE but nevertheless it is much easier to do so. If you are on an modern unix host
the make tool should be integrated in your terminal. On Windows hosts you have to install the GNU Tools first.
