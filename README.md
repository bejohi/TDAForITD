# TDAForITD
An Implementation of the "Topological Data Analysis for Image Tampering Detection" - Approach in Python.
Originally introduced by Aras Asaad and Sabah Jassim (2017)

## Requirements
You need python3 and it's package-installer tool pip installed on your system.
You can download [Python 3 here](https://www.python.org/) or through your systems package manager.
We also provide a MAKEFILE to install all dependencies, run the unit-test session and the application.
It is not necessary to use this MAKEFILE but nevertheless it is much easier to do so. If you are on an modern unix-like host
the make tool should be integrated in your terminal. On Windows hosts you have to install the GNU Tools first.
